# Klbb: Phase 1

My first Phaser project!

## Requirements

* We need Node, so probs see if you've got it `node -v`.
 * If you don't, maybe install it using something like `nvm`. Here's a [handy guide to install it on macOS](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/).
* We also need Webpack!
 * If you don't have it, run `npm install --save-dev webpack`.

## Install and run

Run the following commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |
| `npm build run` | Compile stuff to `build` for deploying to places |

You should be able to view the game at http://localhost:8000 in a local browser!
